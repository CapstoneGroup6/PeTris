To start the project run the commands...

npm install; npm start

Rules for colloboration:
1) Make a new branch for every new feature (not every new component).
   The branch should follow the format feature--your-name, (e.g. TetrisGame-Michael)
2) Style your components using CSS files in the styles directory, the format 
   should be <componentName>.css
3) Once you have enough components for the page/feature you're working on,
   Make a parent component in the pages directory that contains all of the necessary
   components for your feature/page.
